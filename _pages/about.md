My name is Andy Shen.

I am a first-year PhD student in Statistics at **[UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}** working with **[Haiyan Huang](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~hhuang/){:target="_blank"}** and **[Peter Bickel](https://bickel.stat.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}**. My research interests are in applied statistics, specifically related to the biological and medical sciences.


I graduated from **[UCLA](http://statistics.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"}** in June 2021 with my B.Sc. in Statistics. I was very fortunate to have been advised by **[Rick Schoenberg](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~frederic/){:target="_blank"}** and **[Peter Katona](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/katona){:target="_blank"}**. 

I have also spent many summers as a student intern at **[Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://lanl.gov/){:target="_blank"}** where I conducted research with **[Devin Francom](https://www.lanl.gov/search-capabilities/profiles/devin-francom.shtml){:target="_blank"}** and **[Kimberly Kaufeld](https://www.lanl.gov/search-capabilities/profiles/kimberly-kaufeld.shtml){:target="_blank"}**.

My previous research projects have consisted around developing statistical models and methodologies to combat public health issues such as disease forecasting and radiation contamination of water. I have also done extensive research in assessing robustness in Bayesian multivariate adaptive regression splines.
