## Abstract

Water is arguably the most important resource for humanity. Radioactive isotopes (radioisotopes) are commonly found in much of the worldâ€™s drinking water supplies. Some radioisotopes occur naturally, while others come from nuclear or radioactive activity near a water source. Consumption of these substances in large amounts can be harmful and even life-threatening. Certain radioisotopes, such as Caesium-137, Iodine-131, and Strontium-90, are both highly volatile and water-soluble, making their impact even more dangerous. Executing a terrorist attack to contaminate a large body of water is highly unlikely due to the expense and hard-to-obtain material. With water being such a precious resource, the fear of contaminated water has become a hub for fake news, causing distrust and anxiety from the public. Ultimately, our country must find methods to keep our water supplies safe and pure since contaminating a water source has the potential to have a widespread impact on civilians.
